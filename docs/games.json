Being the longest I've worked on a project since my first attemp in junior year high school, and really tested myself as designer working in a genere outside of my general interest on a topic I initially knew little about and as a developer on my ability to manage scope and build maintainable systems. I've learned a lot about Unreal, C++, and game design in general. It was my first attempt at data-driven design, which I used to make creating varied practice routines and other parts of the content centralized and accessible to non-programmers.",
