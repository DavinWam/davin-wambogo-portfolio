                    I'm Davin Wambogo, a Game Designer with a passion for creating engaging worlds for players to
                    explore.
                    I started my game development journey in in 2020, since then I've built over 10 games, and many
                    other experiences, working in small teams.
                    Working primarily on Game Design, and Gameplay Programming. While also having experience in Level
                    Design, UI Design, 3D Modeling & Animation,
                    from various projects. As a designer I try to play games of all types but I'm particularly in RPGs,
                    and Action games.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px;">
                    My time in game development at the University of Maryland has given me extensive experience across
                    many aspects of game creation,
                    and in teams. I double majored in Computer Science and Immersive Media Design(focuses on
                    digital and contemporary experiences).
                    The project I'm most proud of is also my most ambitious, Enya's Journey, was only possible because I
                    had developed skills in many areas and a testament
                    to my growth, and ability to integrate multidisciplinary skills. I'm still eager to keep growing and
                    hopefully build a career as a Game Designer.
