                    Developed during a game jam by a seven-member team, this game combines humor with a high-seas
                    adventure on the world's most advanced, barely seaworthy steamship. Playing as a crew member, the
                    goal is to keep the ship afloat by completing various repair tasks.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed the ship’s layout, the order of repair tasks</li>
                    <li>the player’s moveset, including a steam-powered grappling hook.</li>
                    <li>Contributed to modeling and decorated the ship's interior with assets created by two teammates
                        and myself.</li>
                    <li>Created a class document for the game's code.</li>
                    <li>Optimized a low-poly water script, enhancing performance from 80 to a smoother 160 on my
                        computer.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Highlight of the Project</h2>
            <p class="pane">On "Got Steam, Punk?", the real task was the interior of the ship—making it detailed and
                believable.
                Evan's solid models set the foundation, and together with Jeremy, we added some humor into the mix with
                the signs around the ship. My job was to figure out the best spots for grappling points for players to
                navigate quickly, keeping the gameplay smooth and engaging. I spent a good deal of time ensuring that
                every piece of the ship was placed just right, drawing from real-life references to get that authentic
                steamship feel. Somehow while working on it I never felt confortable with how it looked but
                after having time to look at it now, I'm fonder of the work I did there.</p>
