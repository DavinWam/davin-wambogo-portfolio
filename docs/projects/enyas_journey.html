<h3>Enya's Journey</h3>
<span>(2023)</span>
<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Game Design, Programming, UI, Level Design, Art &amp; Animation</p>
</div>
<div class="pane project-description"><p class="project-description__text"> <strong>Enya's Journey</strong> is a turn RPG that blends pixel-art characters with modeled environments, created for a Game Programming school project over two months by a five-person team as a fantasy adventure built around fire. The player makes use of various fire spells with different utility with 6 classes they can freely swap between, managing heat in combat, and expending it strategically to do massive damage without overheating. My teammates contributed music, narrative writing, sprite creation, pixel art animation, and story programming.</p>
<h4>What I Did</h4>

<h2>Highlight of the Project</h2>
<p class="pane highlights">Working on Enya's Journey was significant to me as an avid fan of RPGs. This project was a testament to my growth as a developer, where I truly felt like I crested the hill where I spent more time creating than learning and an oppurtunity to show true dedication to a single project, 8 or more hours a day consistently. As I reflect it also showed me my limits, whether it be code and the need for proper design patterns, or design and the need to make sure that what I add solves a problem, or that I need to rely on teammates more. Despite how the time on the project was spent you could say it's where I learned the most about game development.</p>
