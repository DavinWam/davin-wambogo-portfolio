                <p>In this project, I focused on getting to grips
                    with Blender, creating a simple but lively animation. I modeled and textured a fish, experimented
                    with node-based textures for the rocks and a volcano, and dipped into fluid and smoke simulations to
                    add a touch of realism to the water and volcanic effects. The animation of the fish swimming through
                    the scene brought everything together. This was a learning experience, a step in developing my
                    skills in 3D animation.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Developed a workflow in Blender from modeling, to UVs,to texturing and finally rigging</li>
                <li>Explored node-based texturing techniques for realistic rock and volcano textures</li>
                <li>Experimented with smoke and water simulation to add some dynamics to the scene</li>
                <li>Learned some of wthe nuances of timing and movement in 3D animation to bring the fish to life</li>

            <h2> What I'm most proud of about this project is...</h2>
            <p class="pane">Tackling the texturing in this project was both a challenge and a joy, and it's definitely the aspect I'm
                most proud of. The time and effort I poured into texturing were substantial, but seeing the final result
                was immensely rewarding. The highlight for me is the glowing textures of the fish. They give it a
                captivating, almost magical appearance that draws the eye. Interestingly, this glow effect, while
                focused on the fish, also inadvertently lent a unique Pacific Islander aesthetic to the volcano. 
                They add depth and character to the scene, as well helped me understand models better. This project was me
                getting my feet wet with UV's and baking normals from a higher poly model and the processes of painting textures.</p>
