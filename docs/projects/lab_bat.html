<h3>Lab Bat</h3>
<span>(2021)</span>
<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Game and Level Designer</p>
</div>
<div class="pane project-description"><p class="project-description__text">Lab Bat is a puzzle platformer inspired by flash game era developed over a three-day game jam. Based on the odd World War II story where they tested using bats as a way to deliver bomvs. In this game, the protagonist, a bat who originally could not fly, navigates a facility filled with hazards to deliver a bomb to its destination in exchange for flight. The player controls the bat's movement to solve puzzles delivering the bomb to the end of the level while avoiding challenges like acid pools and lasers.</p>
<h4>What I Did</h4>
<ul>
<li>Designed all 6 puzzle levels, the players moveset and the level hazards.</li>
<li>Placed the level assets and contributed to pixel art like the ooze containers.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented the UI, including the intro animation.</li>

<h2>Highlight of the Project</h2>
<p class="pane highlights">Within Lab Bat, the fifth level stands out as my personal best. It's where the game starts to truly challenge the player's problem-solving skills. The setup involves placing the crate onto a moving platform, followed by the bomb. Most players instinctively cling to the bomb due to this order, only to find that the crate then obstructs the intended path. I found that the realization that they need to hold onto the crate instead was a satisfying ah-hah moment from watching players in this level.</p>
