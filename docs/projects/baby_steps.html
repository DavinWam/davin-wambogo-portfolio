<p>
                    "Baby Steps" is a VR game where players care for a baby by fulfilling its needs such as being held,
                    fed, and entertained over a 4.5-minute session. The game was created as part of a final project for
                    IMDM290 by a six-person team. It focuses on multitasking gameplay inspired by titles like
                    "Overcooked" and "Tattletail." The game features a cartoon-style shader, various animations, and a
                    fully modeled in-game environment.
                </p>
<h4>What I Did</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrote the cel-shading shader in <strong>HLSL</strong> and implemented the reverse hull technique
                        for outlines.</li>
<li>Painted and detailed the <strong>terrain</strong> for the in-game environment.</li>
<li>Coded the <strong>baby AI</strong>, managing its various states such as Idle, Roaming, and
                        Hungry.</li>
<li>Programmed about half of the <strong>interactable objects</strong>, enhancing gameplay
                        interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlight of the Project</h2>
<p class="pane">
                Working on <strong>Baby Steps</strong> was an incredible learning experience for me, especially in terms
                of becoming more hyper-focused on specific aspects of game development. One of the most rewarding parts
                was demystifying the render pipeline. By hooking into it and injecting custom render information, I
                gained a deeper understanding of how rendering works and how to manipulate it to achieve the desired
                visual effects.
                <br/><br/>
                Another highlight was having the opportunity to hone in on the baby as an entity. Crafting the AI and
                behaviors to make the baby feel alive and fun was a challenge I thoroughly enjoyed. Seeing players pick
                up the baby as soon as the game started and hearing their laughter was incredibly satisfying. It was a
                wonderful reminder of why I love game development—creating moments of joy and engagement for players.
            </p>
