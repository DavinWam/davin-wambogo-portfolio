                <p>
                    Developed as part of an Immersive Media assignment, this VR experience was a collaborative effort by a team of three, inspired by Italo Calvino's *Invisible Cities*. Our group chose the ethereal city of Valdrada, known for its reflection in the waters below. Over the course of a week and a half, we transformed this concept into a 3D scene.

                <ul>
                    <li>Sketched out the basic layout for the map and decided on the necessary assets.</li>
                    <li>Created seven distinct building types using the walls and verandas provided by teammates.</li>
                    <li>Navigated challenges of integrating 2D assets into a 3D environment, addressing lighting and render
                        order issues.</li>
                    <li>Used Substance Designer to create textures for dirt, water, and sand.</li>
                    <li>Utilized Blender and Shader Graph to create grass and water.</li>
                    <li>Performed minor Photoshop work for particle effects.</li>

            <h2>Highlight of the Project</h2>
            <p class="pane">Working on this project was a chance for me to really dive into the visual side of game development,
                something I hadn't focused on much before. It turned out to be a great learning experience, especially
                in creating and using assets efficiently. I'm particularly proud of how I managed to use a few asset
                variations to build the entire set of buildings in the scene. It was like solving a puzzle, figuring out
                how to get the most out of each piece to create a diverse and engaging environment. What stands out to
                me is how these choices in asset use really brought the whole scene together. It looked good, and it
                felt right â€“ it was just how I envisioned it. This project wasn't just about making things look pretty;
                it was a practical lesson in making the most of what you have, and I think that's something that will
                stick with me in my future projects.</p>
