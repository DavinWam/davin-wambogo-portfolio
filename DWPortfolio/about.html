                    I'm Davin Wambogo, a Game Designer with a passion for creating engaging worlds for players to explore.
                    I started getting into game development in 2020, since then I've built my skills in various technical and creative aspects
                    working on, focusing on Game Design, Level Design, and Gameplay Programming. While also having experience in UI Design, 3D Modeling & Animation,
                    from various projects. I am a bit of a gaming generalist but particularly love RPGs, and Action games.
                    As a Game Developer, I try give players a sense of wonder because that's was the feeling that inspired me to become a developer. 
                </p>
                            
                <p style="text-align: left; text-indent:40px;">
                    My time in game development at the University of Maryland has given me extensive experience across many aspects of game creation, 
                    and in teams. Currently, Double Majoring in Computer Science and Immersive Media Design(focuses on digital and contemporary experiences).
                    My major's have given me the chance to put on many hats, but the throughline through each project has been a focus on Game Design.
                    The project I'm most proud of is also my most ambitious, Enya's Journey, was only possible because I had developed skills in many areas and a testament
                    to my growth, and ability to integrate multidisciplinary skills. I'm still eager to keep growing and hopefully build a career as a Game Designer.
